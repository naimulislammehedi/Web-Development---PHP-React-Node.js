# What Happens When You Type a URL in the Browser?
(https://www.example.com/index.html
)

🧭 1. URL Parsing & Protocol Identification 
“I need to use HTTPS to talk to www.example.com
 and request /index.html.”


🌍 2. DNS Lookup (Domain → IP) : The browser needs the server’s actual address (an IP, like 93.184.216.34).
(DNS returns the IP address of the web server hosting the site.)


🔒 3. TCP Handshake (Connection Setup)
browser now connects to the IP via TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

- SYN → Browser says “I want to talk.”
- SYN-ACK → Server says “I’m listening.”
- ACK → Browser confirms.

✅ Connection established — ready for data exchange.


🧱 4. TLS/SSL Handshake (for HTTPS)
If the site uses HTTPS, the browser and server perform an encryption handshake:

- Browser requests the server’s SSL certificate.
- Server sends it; browser verifies it’s valid and trusted.
- Both agree on an encryption method (keys exchanged).
- A secure tunnel is established — all data is now encrypted.

🔐 This ensures no one can spy or tamper with your communication.


📩 5. HTTP Request Sent
The browser sends an HTTP request like this:

"""
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Chrome/141.0
Accept: text/html
"""

- GET = request method
- Host = which server/domain you want
- Headers = extra context about browser, cookies, etc.

(If it’s a POST request, body data is also sent.)


🖥️ 6. Server Processing
The web server receives the request and decides how to respond:

- If it’s a static site (HTML, CSS, images), it fetches files directly.
- If it’s dynamic (PHP, Node.js, etc.), the backend executes code:
    - Queries the database
    - Processes logic (auth, API calls, etc.)
    - Generates HTML or JSON
- The server wraps the response in HTTP headers and sends it back.

"""
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
"""

📦 7. Browser Receives the Response
The browser gets the response (HTML, JSON, or binary data).

If it’s HTML:

- Browser parses HTML → builds DOM Tree
- Downloads linked CSS → builds CSSOM Tree
- Downloads JS → executes it
- Combines both into a Render Tree


🎨 8. Rendering & Painting

Browser engine (like Blink in Chrome) does:

- Layout → Calculates position of every element.
- Paint → Converts layout into actual pixels.
- Compositing → Layers and animations are rendered to the screen.

You see the page visually.


♻️ 9. Subsequent Requests
As browser parses the HTML, it finds more assets:

- CSS files
- JS scripts
- Images, fonts, videos

Each triggers new HTTP(S) requests — repeating the same connection cycle (often faster due to caching and persistent TCP).


🧠 10. Caching, Cookies & Storage

Before closing the connection, browser stores:

- Cache → static files for reuse
- Cookies → session/auth tokens
- LocalStorage/SessionStorage → client-side data

Next time you visit, load time is drastically reduced.

"""
URL → DNS → TCP → TLS → HTTP Request → Server Logic → HTTP Response
     → Browser Parsing → Rendering → Caching
"""


⚙️ Developer Mindset Takeaway
- Frontend devs focus on DOM, CSSOM, JS execution, rendering.
- Backend devs focus on HTTP request handling, routing, DB queries, APIs.
- Full stack devs understand how the entire chain fits together.
